# CSViewer
CSViewer is a CSV Viewer spreadsheet-like program coded using GlowUI and GlowLib

A couple things bothered me about storing very private data using EXCEL or Sheets; I don't know how secure my data really is, and I dont want to have to pay a premium to use a service.
So, I decided to make my own spreadsheet viewer called CSViewer, targetted at editing CSV files in a spreadsheet-type document so that I may trust the program I am using to store my data

The Program current has issues editing very large CSV files.
