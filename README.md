# CSViewer
CSViewer is a CSV Viewer spreadsheet-like program coded using GlowUI and GlowLib

A couple things bothered me about storing very private data using EXCEL or Sheets; I don't know how secure my data really is, and I dont want to have to pay a premium to use a service.
So, I decided to make my own spreadsheet viewer called CSViewer, targetted at editing CSV files in a spreadsheet-type document so that I may trust the program I am using to store my data

The Program current has issues editing very large CSV files, but the intention of creating this program was for data privacy in the form of passwords and smaller information logs, so the bugfix is not my top priorty
